#include <iostream>// So you could start using cout and cin in your code
using namespace std; // So you won't have to keep typing std:: before everthing





int main () {// This is where all of your main code with starts

cout << "Hello World!!" << endl;// Start of your first coding program





  return 0;
}// This where the code will end
